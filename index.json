[{"content":" Primary sources on Syriacs of Ottoman Adıyaman The linked monograph is a transcription Ottoman Turkish into the Latin alphabet of texts relating to the Syriac (Süryânî) community in Adıyaman and its environs. The document is composed of two parts, first being Adıyaman Tarihi, a manuscript written in Syria in the mid-twentieth century. The second part is a collection of articles collected from early-twentieth century Syriac newspapers in both the Ottoman Empire and the United States. All of the above were written in Syro-Ottoman (Ottoman Turkish using the Syriac alphabet) and the transcription reflects the original language. Notably, Adıyaman Tarihi exhibits many non-standard grammatical and orthographic practices, and these have been faithfully preserved here. The document also contains a glossary of Ottoman and Adıyaman dialectal terms so that the texts can be read by modern-day Turkish speakers.\nAdıyaman Tarihi\u003e Adıyaman Tarihi # Adıyaman Tarihi is one of the most remarkable works I have had the pleasure of working on: a first-hand account of the lives of the Syriac population in the Ottoman town of Adıyaman (also known as Hısn-ı Mansûr) during the late Ottoman Empire. The author escapes the local massacres with his life, but in light of ongoing post-war persecution, he eventually flees to mandate Syria, where he would spend the rest of his life.\nI gave a talk on the text during SAYFO 1915: An International Conference on the Genocide of Assyrians/Arameans during the First World War held at Freie Universität Berlin in 2015.\nA map from the text was also featured on the lovely The Afternoon Map blog devoted to Ottoman and Ottoman-adjacent cartography.1\nAdıyamanlı Süryânîler is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

Muhyî-i Gülşenî. İlk Yapma Dil.\nA page from Kitâb-ı Bâleybelen The \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; PDF is available for download, but here are a few short excerpts:\nWords in Bāla’y-balan are not required to have vowel harmony, a distinguishing feature of the Turkish language. Words such as qaydak kapı \u0026lsquo;door, gate\u0026rsquo;, which has both a back q and a front k, would not be possible in a pure Turkish word. This point has further significance when we consider Bāla’y-balan’s suffixes, which will not harmonise with the vowels in the root to which they are attached.\nThe Bāla’y-balan plural is created by the addition of the suffix -ā: نو niv \u0026lsquo;flower\u0026rsquo; and نوا nivā \u0026lsquo;flowers\u0026rsquo;. When the base noun already ends with a -ā, then -y- is added as a buffer between the two vowels. When the base noun ends in the vowel ه [a], then the long ā is added, and the ه is vocalised with its consonontal value [h]: ظفه ẓafa \u0026lsquo;book\u0026rsquo;, ظفها ẓafahā.\nA noun may be placed in accusative case by the addition of the suffix -rā. This may be added to both singular and plural nouns: شَمْسَا نِوَارَا Şamsā nivārā \u0026lsquo;They smelled the flowers\u0026rsquo;.\nBāla’y-balan is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The modern English \u0026ldquo;hill\u0026rdquo; was appended later, after the original meaning of Pendle had become opaque.\nThis reminded me of a similar triple tautology I came across as a graduate student reading copies of a monthly journal from the early twentieth century.\nMürşid-i Âsûriyûn, May 1912 Reading right-to-left, you can see it right there at the start of the second line: ܔܒܠܛܘܪ ܛܐܓ݂ . That\u0026rsquo;s cebel (Arabic for \u0026ldquo;mountain\u0026rdquo;), tûr (Syriac for \u0026ldquo;mountain\u0026rdquo;) and dağ (Turkish for, you guessed it, \u0026ldquo;mountain\u0026rdquo;).1\nThe text above was written in Ottoman Turkish, and for consistency, I am using standard Turkish transliteration for all the foreign language words. It\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out that cebel is pronounced \u0026ldquo;jebel\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;mountain\u0026rdquo; in question here was actually the Tur Abdin region in modern Turkey, ironically a region that has no mountains and can be described as hilly at best.\nAs a small aside, the journal Mürşid-i Âsûriyûn that this place name came from is interesting a in a few ways:\nIf the image above looks handwritten, that\u0026rsquo;s because it was. The publisher, Âşûr Yûsuf, printed copies using a technique called mimeography. The journal existed between 1909 and 1914 in the ancient city of Harpût, then a provincial capital and was mailed to subscribers across the Ottoman Empire and as far away as the United States. Ottoman Turkish was usually written using the Arabic alphabet, but Âşûr Yûsuf used the Syriac alphabet in Mürşid-i Âsûriyûn. This was the first journal to be printed in Ottoman Turkish with Syriac letters, but it was followed by several more. You could still find them being published in Lebanon and the United States into the 1930s. Syriac Arabic Latin ܔܒܠ جبل cebel ܛܘܪ طور tûr ܛܐܓ݂ طاغ dağ Âşûr Yûsuf was a native speaker of Armenian and he did not know the Syriac language, despite identifying as a Syriac (Süryânî) and an Assyrian (Âsûrî). Like any other speaker of Ottoman Turkish, he would have been well-acquainted with the common word cebel despite not speaking Arabic himself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting to compare his usage to some other notable topological features in the Ottoman Empire:\nMount Sinai is جبل الطور (Cebel et-Tûr) in Arabic and was جبل طور (Cebel‑i Tûr) in Ottoman Turkish.2 The Mount of Olives near Jerusalem was also Cebel‑i Tûr (although it is simply الطور in Arabic). Mount Gerizim near Nablus is another Cebel et-Tûr. In the Arabic and the Ottoman cases where we find both cebel and tûr, speakers would have understood these names to mean something like \u0026ldquo;Tûr Mountain\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen I originally read the passage above, I also transliterated the place name as Cebel‑i Tûr Dağı, but looking at the text again, I can see that the author intended it to be read Cebeltûr Dağı. My original reading would have required a space between the first two words, so ܔܒܠ ܛܘܪ ܛܐܓ݂ , but that space is quite clearly not there.\nAnd that, I suppose, is the difference. Cebel-i Tûr (with a space) was \u0026ldquo;Mount Tûr\u0026rdquo; and no Dağ was necessary or even possible. But Cebeltûr (no space) had become a set phrase much like Penhul. And it was acceptable for a Turkish-speaker to call this place Cebeltûr Dağı: \u0026ldquo;Mount Cebeltûr\u0026rdquo;.\nObservant readers will note that it is actually ܔܒܠܛܘܪ ܛܐܓ݂ܢܢ in the original text but the final two characters are the Turkish grammatical suffix -ının which we can ignore.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn Turkish today, Tûr Dağı has replaced the Persian grammatical construct which you see in Cebel-i Tûr. And both now and then, Mount Sinai had many different names, including Cebel-i Sînâ.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/articles/mt-mountain-mountain/","section":"Articles","summary":"An Ottoman Turkish tautology Wikipedia has an article on a place called Pendle Hill, noteworthy, perhaps, mainly for being a triple tautology:\nThe name \u0026ldquo;Pendle Hill\u0026rdquo; combines the words for hill from three different languages \u0026hellip; In the 13th century it was called Pennul or Penhul, apparently from the Cumbric pen and Old English hyll, both meaning \u0026ldquo;hill\u0026rdquo;.","title":"Mount Mountain Mountain"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/ottoman/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ottoman"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/postgis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"postgis"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/postgresql/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"postgresql"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/python/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"python"},{"content":"I authored two Python modules that make it easier to use geospatial Python from within your PostgreSQL database.\nplpygis\u003e plpygis # plpygis is a Python conveter to and from the PostGIS geometry type, WKB, EWKB, GeoJSON and Shapely geometries and additionally supports __geo_interface__. plpygis is intended for use in PL/Python functions, making the entire Python geospatial ecosystem available in SQL queries.\nA simple Python function using plpygis would be:\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION swap(geom geometry) RETURNS geometry AS $$ # swaps the x and y coordinates of a point from plpygis import Geometry, Point old_point = Geometry(geom) new_point = Point([old_point.y, old_point.x]) return new_point $$ LANGUAGE plpython3u; The magic happens with Geometry(geom), which is automatically converts from PostGIS\u0026rsquo;s geometry type, and the return statement, which automatically converts back to a PostGIS geometry.\nThe function above can be called with a normal SQL statement:\nSELECT swap(geom) FROM city; I spoke about plpygis at FOSS4G 2017 in Boston.
