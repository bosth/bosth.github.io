The linked monograph is a transcription Ottoman Turkish into the Latin alphabet of texts relating to the Syriac (Süryânî) community in Adıyaman and its environs. The document is composed of two parts, first being *Adıyaman Tarihi*, a manuscript written in Syria in the mid-twentieth century. The second part is a collection of articles collected from early-twentieth century Syriac newspapers in both the Ottoman Empire and the United States. All of the above were written in Syro-Ottoman (Ottoman Turkish using the Syriac alphabet) and the transcription reflects the original language. Notably, *Adıyaman Tarihi* exhibits many non-standard grammatical and orthographic practices, and these have been faithfully preserved here. The document also contains a glossary of Ottoman and Adıyaman dialectal terms so that the texts can be read by modern-day Turkish speakers.

## *Adıyaman Tarihi*

*Adıyaman Tarihi* is one of the most remarkable works I have had the pleasure of working on: a first-hand account of the lives of the Syriac population in the Ottoman town of Adıyaman (also known as Hısn-ı Mansûr) during the late Ottoman Empire. The author escapes the local massacres with his life, but in light of ongoing post-war persecution, he eventually flees to mandate Syria, where he would spend the rest of his life.

I gave [a talk](https://www.assyriatv.org/2015/08/international-conference-seyfo-1915-panel-iii-part-ii/) on the text during *SAYFO 1915: An International Conference on the Genocide of Assyrians/Arameans during the First World War* held at Freie Universität Berlin in 2015.

A map from the text was also featured on the lovely [The Afternoon Map](http://www.midafternoonmap.com/2013/03/adiyaman-by-hand.html) blog devoted to Ottoman and Ottoman-adjacent cartography.[^1]
