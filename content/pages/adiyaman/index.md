Primary sources on Syriacs of Ottoman Adıyaman

The linked monograph is a transcription from Ottoman Turkish into the Latin alphabet of texts relating to the Syriac (Süryânî) community in Adıyaman and its environs. The document is composed of two parts, first being *Adıyaman Tarihi*, a manuscript written by Bulıs Monofar in Syria in the mid-twentieth century. The second part is a collection of articles collected from early-twentieth century Syriac newspapers in both the Ottoman Empire and the United States.

These documents were all written in Syro-Ottoman (Ottoman Turkish using the Syriac alphabet).

My document also contains a glossary of Ottoman and Adıyaman dialectal terms so that the texts can be read by modern-day Turkish speakers.

## *Adıyaman Tarihi*

*Adıyaman Tarihi* is one of the most remarkable works I have had the pleasure of working on: a first-hand account of the lives of the Syriac population in the Ottoman town of Adıyaman (also known as Hısn-ı Mansûr) during the late Ottoman Empire.

During the First World War, the author avoids the local massacres, but in light of ongoing post-war persecution, he eventually flees to mandate Syria, where he would spend the rest of his life and where he would write his biography.

*Adıyaman Tarihi* exhibits many non-standard grammatical and orthographic practices compared to the more formal language used by others writing in Syro-Ottoman, and these have been faithfully preserved in my document.

I gave [a talk](https://www.assyriatv.org/2015/08/international-conference-seyfo-1915-panel-iii-part-ii/) on the text during *SAYFO 1915: An International Conference on the Genocide of Assyrians/Arameans during the First World War* held at Freie Universität Berlin in 2015.

A map from the text was also featured on [The Afternoon Map](http://www.midafternoonmap.com/2013/03/adiyaman-by-hand.html) blog devoted to Ottoman and Ottoman-adjacent cartography.[^1]
