An Ottoman constructed language
{{< /lead >}}

World-famous constructed languages range from Zamenhof's Esperanto to Tolkien's Quenya to hobbyist "[conlangs](https://conlang.org/)", but isn't it surprising to learn that centuries before them, an Ottoman in Egypt created his own language and that a thorough grammar and lexicon survives to this day?

Conlanging before it became cool was the scholar and mystic Mehmed ibn Fethullah ibn Ebü Tâlib, born in Edirne in the mid-16th century and spending the majority of his life in Ottoman Cairo.

I started writing an English-language overview of Bāla’y-balan's grammar based on both the original text as preserved in Princeton University's library and a modern Turkish translation by Mustafa Koç, *Bâleybelen. Muhyî-i Gülşenî. İlk Yapma Dil*.

The "full" PDF is available for download, but here are a few short excerpts:

> Words in Bāla’y-balan are not required to have vowel harmony, a distinguishing feature of the Turkish language. Words such as **qaydak** *kapı* 'door, gate', which has both a back **q** and a front **k**, would not be possible in a pure Turkish word. This point has further significance when we consider Bāla’y-balan’s suffixes, which will not harmonise with the vowels in the root to which they are attached.

> The Bāla’y-balan plural is created by the addition of the suffix **-ā**: {{< ar "نو" >}} **niv** 'flower' and {{< ar "نوا" >}} **nivā** 'flowers'. When the base noun already ends with a **-ā**, then **-y-** is added as a buffer between the two vowels. When the base noun ends in the vowel {{< ar ه >}} [a], then the long **ā** is added, and the {{< ar ه >}} is vocalised with its consonontal value [h]: {{< ar ظفه >}} **ẓafa** 'book', {{< ar ظفها >}} **ẓafahā**.

> A noun may be placed in accusative case by the addition of the suffix **-rā**. This may be added to both singular and plural nouns: {{< ar "شَمْسَا نِوَارَا" >}} **Şamsā nivārā** 'They smelled the flowers'.
