I did my graduate studies at [Boğaziçi Üniversitesi](http://www.boun.edu.tr/) in Istanbul under the direction of the [Vangelis Kechriotis](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/soeu-2015-630408/html). My research topic was the Ottoman *Süryânî* (Syriac) community during the Second Constitutional Period.

## Publications

### The Ottoman *Süryânî* from 1908 to 1914

This is the first academic work to rely on primary sources written in the Syro-Ottoman language and attempts to apply Ottomanist historiography to Syriac history. It was first published by [Gorgias Press](https://www.gorgiaspress.com/) in 2009 and received its second printing in 2019.

From the [publisher's website](https://www.gorgiaspress.com/benjamin-trigona-harany):

> This work explores the misconceptions about the Ottoman *Süryânî* community of the pre-World War I era, using a critique of the present day historiography as the context for the discussion. The works of three early twentieth century journalists, provide the material for the study. The author contends that this group cannot be considered as Assyrian nationalists, the traditional argument, that they saw the future of the *Süryânî* people as best secured by the continuation of the Ottoman Empire, in which they sought a greater presence for their community.
