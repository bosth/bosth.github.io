A geospatial solution to Ottoman travel times
{{< /lead >}}

Imagine you were a bureaucrat in the Ottoman government and your posting as assistant governor of the province of Sivas had ended and you were about to take up a position on a commission in the city of Selânik (Thessaloniki).[^cercis]

How would you have made that journey? How long would it have taken?

As a graduate student, I had come across raw data on travel times in some Ottoman primary sources, and this raw data can be fed into a routing engine to calculate the optimal journey for our imaginary Ottoman. This is how I found the data and built the engine.

## The Data

### *Sâlnâme*s

The first sources are the provincial *sâlnâme*s, annals or almanacs published by the governments of each *vilâyet* (province) from the mid-1860s onwards. The *sâlnâme*s contain a wealth of information of interest to a researcher, including administrative, demographic and economic data; in addition, many *sâlnâme*s also include lists or tables giving travel times between important settlements inside the province or between the province and other important Ottoman cities.

#### *Sâlnâme-i Vilâyet-i Van*

As an example, the yearbook for Van from 1315 [1897/1898] has a list of travel times for the provincial capital and district centres.

#### *Sâlnâme-i Vilâyet-i Adana*

The Adana yearbook from 1318 [1900/1901] presents similar information but in table format.

### Maps

In aggregate, the provincial *sâlnâme*s have a tremendous amount of data in them, and it would be possible to reconstruct a graph of travel times for the entire Ottoman Empire. This was briefly my initial approach but I found that this work had already done by contemporary cartographers and that several maps could be leveraged to ease the process.

#### Ottoman map from 1855/1856

The oldest map that I have found dates back to 1272 [1855/1856], although the border with the Kingdom of Greece does not appear to match the actual border in 1855 (or any other year). The map is entirely in Ottoman Turkish.

![Entire map image](map_1856.webp "")

* Every point-to-point connection has a travel time indicated.
* Approximate *vilâyet* borders are shown.
* There are tables showing travel times from Istanbul, Samsun, Trabzon, Varna, İzmir and Selânik.
* Maritime connections are not shown.
* Bosnia and everything north of the Danube are omitted.
* Most of Iraq and everything south of Damascus are omitted.

![Thrace and the Dardanelles](featured.webp "Connections in Thrace and the Dardanelles")

![Varna](map_1856_varna.webp "Travel times from Varna")

#### Ottoman map from 1891/1892

The second map dates from 1309 [1891/1892] and is also in Ottoman Turkish. It provides significantly more detail than the previous map, including in areas which were never or no longer part of the Ottoman Empire.[^danforth]

![Istanbul to Ankara](map_1891_istanbul.webp "Sea of Marmara and the Istanbul-Ankara railway")

* Most point-to-point connections have travel times. The missing times are typically for regions outside the Ottoman Empire, but there are exceptions.
* The symbology of settlements differs depending on their administrative function (e.g. the administrative centre of a *vilâyet* is different from that of a *kazâ*).
* Four different types of connections are shown: railroads, *chaussée*s, main roads and roads.
* Maritime connections are not shown.
* Travel times between major ports are shown as a table.

![Legend](map_1891_palestine.webp "Map legend and connections in Palestine")

#### French map from 1899

The final map is the work of one R. Huber and is based off of the 1317 [1899] *sâlnâme*. Unlike the previous two maps, it is not in Ottoman Turkish, but French, and it has less detail.

* Most point-to-point connections have travel times. Rail connections are measured in kilometres.
* *Vilâyet* and *sancak* borders are shown.
* Population figures and other figures are given for administrative subdivisions.
* The symbology of settlements differs depending on their administrative function (e.g. the administrative centre of a *vilâyet* is different from that of a *kazâ*).
* Four different types of connections are shown: railroads, projected railroads, *chaussée*s, roads and maritime routes.

## The Engine

As a proof-of-concept, I digitised a significant part of the 1899 map, encoding the settlements as points and the connections between them as lines in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) support.

![QGIS](qgis.webp "Network of edges and nodes in QGIS")

Network analysis for point-to-point travel is a well-understood problem, and [pgRouting](https://pgrouting.org/) implements [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) to find the lowest-cost path between two nodes, using the hours listed on the map as the cost of each edge.

Using Dijkstra's algorithm and the data from the 1899 map, I calculated the optimal route between Sivas and Selânik would have taken almost five days:

* Sivas to Tokat via Kargın (road, 16h)
* Tokat to Ünye via Gümenek, Niksar, Karakuş (chaussee, 1 day, 5 hours)
* Ünye to Selânik via Samsun, İstanbul, Gelibolu, Çanakkale (ship, 3 days)

## An Application

I published a simple web application as "Ottoman Route Finder" at https://www.jaxartes.net/ottoman-route-finder/ so anyone can calculate that it takes about six days and ten hours to travel from Devebağırtan Kapısı to İd.

![Route plan](devebagirtankapisi.webp "Route plan from Devebağırtan Kapısı in the Balkans to İd near Erzurum")

In addition to PostgreSQL, PostGIS and pgRouting, I am using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) as a web-mapping library.

### Limitations

* The application is only as good as the input data so I am relying on the mapmakers' and *sâlnâme* authors' accuracy.
* In some cases, maps show connections but there is no travel time given; in those cases, I estimated the travel time based on the connection type and the typical time needed to travel that distance based on other connections in the map. This assumption may be wrong.
* I added ferries across the Bosphorus and known tramlines inside Istanbul and Izmir, but I do not have timetables for these, so durations are estimated.
* On the map, the railway connections are measured in kilometres rather than hours, so I had to estimate the journey times. However, I did find the duration of train travel for some journeys in other sources (for example Mudanya to Bursa), so I was able to program in accurate rail journey times for those.
* In all cases, the travel times that you see do not include any time spent waiting for onward transportation or time spent at intermediary points.
